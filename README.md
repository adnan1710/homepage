# My Homepage

This is my first web development project which I've developed, out of curiosity and interest, with whatever limited CSS I knew.
It entirely consists of HTML and CSS at the moment, CSS Bootstrap and javascript will be added as I learn and implement the further topics, until then stay with me on completing this project step by step.

Open to suggestions on how to improve and make this more asthetically pleasing!!
